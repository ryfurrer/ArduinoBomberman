How to play:
Use the joystick to navigate.
Pressing in the joystick is referred to as pressing the select button in the game.

Bomberman is a maze-based video game where the player tries to destroy all the enemies and then find the exit.
In our version you will try to kill all the enemies on the map until they are all dead and a you move on to the next level or you die.
New levels increase in the number of enemies.
The player can place bombs onto the map by pressing the joystick select button. The amount of bombs the player can place is limited.
After a set period of time a set bomb will explode with a “plus-shaped” radius, killing anything that happens to be within its explosion radius.
Bombs can destroy trees and enemies.
Some trees may contain powerups.

General code layout:
Ballerman.cpp:  anything to do with the player or game logic
Enemies.cpp:    anything to with the enemies except player/enemy collison
mapAndDraw.cpp: anything that uses the lcd screen or is used to make the map
